# ask.opensource.construction â€“ "Blackboard"

This RFC outlines the ideas behind the opensource.construction communication efforts outlined in https://opensource-construction.github.io/initiative/#21-key-activities-in-2023204.

## Problem

The AEC industry is very prone to toil and re-work as knowledge usually resides in individuals, to a lesser degree organisations, but almost never cross-organisation - despite a high degree of professions collaborating on a single project. This leads to the [**learning problem**](https://opensource-construction.github.io/initiative#what-we-see-in-aeco). Often the highly specific, but low level questions and their solutions benefit the most from being exchanged and build upon instead.

Currently there is no low barrier entry space to ask simple questions and exchange ideas.

## Solution

We propose opensource.construction to host and manage a community around sharing knowledge, workflows, software and data in the AEC industry. This is comprised of

- **infrastructure**: providing a technical infrastrcuture capable of hosting a forum / ask like platform
- **moderation**: moderating that community with a best effort approach, inviting volunteers to be responsible for topics / sub-communities
